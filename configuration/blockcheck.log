* checking system
Linux detected
firewall type is iptables
* checking already running DPI bypass processes
* checking privileges
* checking prerequisites
* checking DNS
system DNS is working
no working public DNS was found. looks like public DNS blocked.
checking resolved IP uniqueness for : pornhub.com ntc.party rutracker.org www.torproject.org bbc.com
censor's DNS can return equal result for multiple blocked domains.
all resolved IPs are unique
-- DNS looks good
-- NOTE this check is Russia targeted. In your country other domains may be blocked.
* checking virtualization
running on bare metal

NOTE ! this test should be run with zapret or any other bypass software disabled, without VPN

specify domain(s) to test. multiple domains are space separated.
domain(s) (default: rutracker.org) : ip protocol version(s) - 4, 6 or 46 for both (default: 4) : 
check http (default : Y) (Y/N) ? 
check https tls 1.2 (default : Y) (Y/N) ? 
TLS 1.3 uses encrypted ServerHello. DPI cannot check domain name in server response.
This can allow more bypass strategies to work.
What works for TLS 1.2 will also work for TLS 1.3 but not vice versa.
Most sites nowadays support TLS 1.3 but not all. If you can't find a strategy for TLS 1.2 use this test.
TLS 1.3 only strategy is better than nothing.
check https tls 1.3 (default : N) (Y/N) ? 
installed curl version does not support http3 QUIC. tests disabled.

sometimes ISPs use multiple DPIs or load balancing. bypass strategies may work unstable.
how many times to repeat each test (default: 1) : 
quick - scan as fast as possible to reveal any working strategy
standard - do investigation what works on your DPI
force - scan maximum despite of result
1 : quick
2 : standard
3 : force
your choice (default : standard) : selected : standard

ipv4 yandex.ru curl_test_https_tls12 : working without bypass

Please note this SUMMARY does not guarantee a magic pill for you to copy/paste and be happy.
Understanding how strategies work is very desirable.
This knowledge allows to understand better which strategies to prefer and which to avoid if possible, how to combine strategies.
Blockcheck does it's best to prioritize good strategies but it's not bullet-proof.
It was designed not as magic pill maker but as a DPI bypass test tool.
